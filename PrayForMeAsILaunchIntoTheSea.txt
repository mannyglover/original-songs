Pray for me, as I launch into the sea.
And I'll pray for you, as you stay on the ground.
What is this life?  I don't know.  I can't tell.
Oh oh oh, what is this life?  I don't know.  I don't know--

I know that your place is comfier
In some ways but your bed's made of stone.
You are confused bout not bein confused.
I know more, but I still feel abused.  Feel abused--

Now that I'm coming close to the shore
I will wave, but maybe no more.
It's been too long, we both know, it feels wrong,
But we'll smile, awkwardly, it's the best we can do. We can do--
