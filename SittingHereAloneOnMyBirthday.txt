Chords: Gmaj7 A D Bm

Sitting here alone alone on my birthday
Being a disappointment to all
Got about 50 friends who I quite like
Yeah about 50 friends I could call

When I first wake
up I feel like
maybe today's 
a new day.

Then it hits me
Its exactly
As empty as yesterday.

Getting none of my goals done.
Reaching out to no one.
Scrolling Reddit for hours an' hours
Trust me this is no fun.

Dancing by myself
Dancing by myself
Dancing by my
Dancing by myself
All by myself
