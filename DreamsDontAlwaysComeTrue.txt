[Guitar starts off fingerpicking]

Chorus
Dreams
Oh dreams
Don’t always come true
They’re
Oh they’re
Not always going to

[Instrumental]
[fingerpicking turns into emphatic strumming halfway through this first instrumental]

Verse
You feel it
You feel it
You feel it
In your brain

That you’ve got a gift
You’ve gotta share
Or else
You’ll go insane

You know it
You know it
You know it
In your heart

That your whole life
Has been pointing
To yourself
Creating art

You got it
You got it
You got just
What it takes

And even God Him
Self told you
He’ll give you
That big break

You’re so high
You’re so high
You’re so high
When your on

That is obvious
That destiny
Is carrying
You along

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

Verse
You love her
You love her
You love her
So damn much

You can’t forget
Her lovely
Eyes or her
Gentle touch

You’ve never
You’ve never
You’ve never
Felt this way

Must be a sign
That her behind
Will’be yours again
Someday

She’s classy
She’s classy
She’s classy
She reads a lot books

She has that
Girl next door thing
When she gives
Those charming looks

She’s flirting
She’s flirting
She’s flirting
Once again

She must have been
Mistaken when
She said she wanna
Be friends
